# Subassembly_PB_IndelCorrection

Correcting indels to PacBio reads for subassembly

#### Running instructions on GS Cluster
qsub ./driver_SUL1_test.sh

#### Running locally

Scripts are now edited to run locally. To run on the cluster, download an older version (before 10/2/2020).  
To set up your environment, install [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) and ensure it is working on your computer. Load the environment `conda env create --file msaccs_env.yml`  
The msa_pacbio.py script utilizes the multiple sequence aligner, [MUSCLE](https://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm) and Needle through 
[EMBOSS](http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/adminguide/node7.html).  
To install MUSCLE, extract the zipped MUSCLE file `tar -zxvf muscle_filename_here.tar.gz`. The MUSCLE software is ready to run as soon as it is unzipped.  
For the EMBOSS file, unzip it `tar -zxvf emboss_filename_here.tar.gz`. Through terminal, go to the unzipped EMBOSS directory and type `./configure`. When that is finished, type `make` (this may take 5-10 minutes). The software needed through EMBOSS is called needle, which is located in `EMBOSS-versionX/emboss/needle`.  
  
In your driver script, be sure to specify the location of each software.
  
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
