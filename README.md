# Subassembly_PB_IndelCorrection

Correcting indels to PacBio reads for subassembly

#### Running instructions
qsub ./driver_SUL1_test.sh

#### Running locally

Scripts are now edited to run locally. To run on the cluster, download a previous version.  
The msa_pacbio.py script utilizes the multiple sequence aligner, MUSCLE (https://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm) and Needle through EMBOSS (ftp://emboss.open-bio.org/pub/EMBOSS/).  
To install MUSCLE, extract the zipped MUSCLE file `tar -zxvf muscle_filename_here.tar.gz`. The MUSCLE software is ready to run as soon as it is unzipped.  
For the EMBOSS file, unzip it `tar -zxvf emboss_filename_here.tar.gz`. Through terminal, go to the unzipped EMBOSS directory and type `./configure`. When that is finished, type `make` (this may take 5-10 minutes). The software needed through EMBOSS is called needle, which is located in `EMBOSS-versionX/emboss/needle`.  
  
In your driver script, be sure to specify the location of each software.

**-d**	**--directory**	Specify working directory where intermediate and output files will be located  
**-o**	**--out**	Specify the name of the final output file  (default = Seq_barcodes_aligned.txt)  
**--highQual**		File of barcode-variant association, where the variant is the highest quality read  
**--inputSeqs**		Raw barcode, variant, and quality of sequencies  
**-c**	**--cutoff**	Minimum number of CCS reads needed in order to retain reads associated with specific barcodes (default = 2)  
**-t**	**--threshold**	Minimum frequency threshold for calling consensus reads (default = 0.7)  
**-v**	**--verbose**	Debug output  
**-m**	**--muscle**	Location of compiled/extracted MUSCLE program
**-n**	**--needle**	Location of compiled Needle program
